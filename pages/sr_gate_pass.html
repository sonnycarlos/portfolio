        <p>SR Gate Pass is a cloud-based gate pass-booking system and a suite of mobile ID progressive web app used by a subdivision to issue and manage digital ID and community. An all-in-one digital identity solution. My team was assigned to fill the gap between residents, guests, and security guards of the real estate. I was the team leader and responsible for product, visual, UI, UX design, and development on this project.</p>

        <h2>Ideation</h2>

        <p>
          We kicked off the project with a research, hypothesis, and analysis phase where we came together with Homeowners Association Officers of the Silverdale Residences to define HMW’s (How Might We) and ideate on possible solutions and features for the app.
          <br />
          <br />
          The Silverdale Residences’ system is old-fashioned: they use stickers for the homeowners' vehicles to easily identify whether the entry is authorized or not, but as for those who walk and use public transport as well as guests and workers, the only way they can get to know them is by asking questions even sometimes unwanted guests gets inside the estate. And also, the residents still have to go to the gate to inform the security guards that the incoming guest has been invited by them.
          <br />
          <br />
          SR Gate Pass helps the Silverdale Residences’ community to fill the gap between residents, guests, and security guards by providing NFC card and digital ID as gate pass and booking system to facilitate the entry of guests and to identify whether the person entering is authorized or not. It also improves the security management and lower the crime and incident of their community.

        <h2>Typography</h2>
        <p>I used the SF Pro Display font — a modern, geometric sans-serif typeface. The use of sans-serif fonts infuses the design with a contemporary feel, while also enhancing clarity and usability. The font's essence lies in its embodiment of elegant simplicity. This font is simple and open, with just enough character in the ligatures to maintain an engaging visual appeal.</p>
