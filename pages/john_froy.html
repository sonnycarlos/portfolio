        <p>A complete overhaul of John Froy’s outdated website that helped me land my first job as a mid-level web designer in the U.S. The design assessment required transforming his outdated website into a modern, visually appealing, and user-friendly experience.</p>

          <h2>Design Process</h2>
  
          <p>Upon reviewing the current website, johnfoy.com, I found it to be overwhelming for users due to the excessive amount of content on the homepage. To better understand the user experience, I putted myself in the shoes of a persona seeking an attorney in Georgia. What I wanted to see were the attorneys available and important content without being inundated with excessive information. Thus, I aimed to streamline and reduce the content on the website as much as possible. And also, I've designed the website to be responsive on mobile phones for a better user experience, considering that many people today use their smartphones in their daily lives.</p>

          <h2>Hero</h2>
  
          <p>Users typically spend less than 15 seconds on a website, which represents the average duration of their visit. That's the average time spent. And that's how long you have to capture someone's attention on your website. Therefore, I used the text 'You don't pay unless we win' for effective advertising and I placed John Foy as the hero image, showcasing himself and his smile to instill trust.</p>
        </div>

        <img src='../assets/images/john_froy_hero_section_default_image.webp' alt='Image' class='hidden'>

        <p class='hidden'>I also included an animated circle call-to-action button that follows the mouse pointer within the hero section. However, it does not appear when the mouse hovers over the text and buttons.</p>

          <h2>Trusted By Section</h2>

          <p>
            I included logos of the companies and firms collaborating with John Foy on the website, demonstrating the trusted partnerships established by John Foy and instilling confidence in users.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            On the current website of John Foy, there are too much paragraphs where they introduce John Foy and the firm and it's kinda overwhelming for the visitors to read, so to address this, I added a video featuring John Froy.

          <h2>Strong Arm Scholarship Section</h2>

          <p>John Foy & Associates offers a scholarship program in Georgia, a section that cannot be missed! Therefore, I kept it displayed on the website and designed its theme to be more engaging and appealing.</p>

          <p>I discovered that John Foy has written blog posts about legal services, so I decided to display them on the website and design a visually appealing layout for that section. I've also added the average number of minutes to read so users can have an idea of how long the blog post is.</p>

          <p>Before the landing page ends, I wanted to prompt users to subscribe to John Foy & Associates to receive the latest announcements. Additionally, I included an attention-catching question and answer by John Foy that looks like a motivational quote.</p>

          This redesign transformed John Froy’s law firm website into a modern, professional, and user-friendly platform. It was a pivotal design assessment that not only enhanced the site’s functionality but also marked the beginning of my journey as a mid-level web designer in the U.S.
