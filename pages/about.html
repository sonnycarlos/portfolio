      <h2 class='hidden'>I'm a Filipino designer specializing in creating visually stunning and eye-catching designs. Design is my daily bread and butter. With a keen eye for detail and a love for innovative solutions and strategies, I strive to bring ideas to life and make a lasting impact through my work.</h2>

      <h2 class='hidden'>Design is a part of me. It's who I am.</h2>

      <h2 class='hidden'>I enjoy reading books and writing in my spare time.</h2>

      <div>
        <p class='hidden'>One of my proses:</p>
        <img src='../assets/images/prose_image.webp' alt='Image' class='hidden'>
      </div>

      <h2 class='hidden'>I first learned programming before getting into design. Since my college program was BSIT, it focused mostly on programming, not on the design.</h2>

      <h2 class='hidden'>After my first semester of freshman year in college, I became passionate about my program and started having big dreams and plans. I wanted to achieve all of them, so I rushed things. I dropped out during my sophomore year to study on my own so I could land a tech job as soon as possible. My journey was worth it, and I made significant progress. I used to wake up at 3 o’clock in the morning to study until night.</h2>

      <h2 class='hidden'>Fast forward, I didn’t enjoy developing applications because the designs I used were not good. It was boring. So, I tried learning design. My designs weren't great yet, but that's one of the reasons I started my journey in design.</h2>

      <h2 class='hidden'>I tried building a community and made connections worldwide. Santiago was my first partner. He was a senior scrum master and product manager. We formed a team with professionals to develop a product that we planned to turn into a startup company soon, but it failed.</h2>

      <h2 class='hidden'>After a few months, I had personal problems, so I needed to find a job in Manila, even if it wasn't a tech job. Eventually, a senior software engineer discovered my potential and helped me out. He offered me a tech job as a CRM automation specialist. I passed all the interviews and got hired, but I declined the offer. The reasons were that I didn’t trust myself to do the job and I wanted to go back to school and get a degree.</h2>

      <h2 class='hidden'>Expectations turned into disappointments.</h2>

      <h2 class='hidden'>After all of what happened, he still trusted me and gave me a second chance. He invited me to join in their startup company as a front-end developer, where I met one of our senior UI/UX designers. I accepted the offer. This designer became one of my idols and inspirations in design. He was also one of the reasons I entered the world of design.</h2>

      <h2 class='hidden'>He trained me, he criticized me, while I was developing the company’s product.</h2>

      <h2 class='hidden'>Suddenly, we failed to build our product because they all had their own jobs. Only two of us were left, and we wanted to continue the product until my partner gave up. I decided to focus on studying instead and enter the world of freelancing.</h2>

      <h2 class='hidden'>My freelancing was successful. I earned a lot of money that helped me with my college expenses.</h2>

      <h2 class='hidden'>Fast forward, during my internship, I was selected as one of the students to be recruited by the university to develop systems for the employees and departments. I was made the lead front-end developer and lead UI/UX designer by the supervisor there because of my good experience. We successfully completed the system within just two months, and as my internship was coming to an end, I decided to apply for a tech job since I felt ready to enter the industry and confident in my abilities.</h2>

      <h2 class='hidden'>I got hired by a US-based company as a mid-level web designer as my first job.</h2>

      <h2 class='hidden'>I am happy to have worked at Scylla as a web designer, where I designed websites for law firms, medical doctors, and clinics. This marked a fresh start in my journey as a designer. Now, I am happy in my second job as a UI/UX designer for the largest affiliate conferences in the world, Affiliate World Conferences. My mission is to help the company drive innovation through my creativity and expertis</h2>

      <h2 class='hidden'>After all of the failures and what happened to me, I’m still here. Never give up.</h2>

      <h2 class='hidden'>God is a designer.</h2>
