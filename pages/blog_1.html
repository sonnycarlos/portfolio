        <p>Job hunting can be exhausting, especially when rejection after rejection makes you question your abilities. That’s exactly where I was. After countless resume submissions and no callbacks, I knew I had to change something.</p>

        <p>When I first came across the job posting, I saw the role perfectly aligned with everything I had been building toward. The company had the kind of creative culture I craved, the kind of clients I admired, and the kind of work that challenged norms instead of recycling them. I was <em>hooked</em>.</p>
        
        <p>But that excitement quickly turned into anxiety. The competition was going to be fierce. And a good portfolio and resume weren’t going to cut through the noise.</p>

        <p>So I made a decision early on: <em>if I wanted this job, I couldn’t just apply for it—I had to design for it</em>.</p>

        <p>This was my first job application after finishing college. The job pool was huge—hundreds of applicants—and when I made it to the final round with just twelve other candidates, I knew it was my one shot to stand out.</p>

        <p>So I asked myself: <em>How do I outplay other candidates who may have the same hard skills as me?</em></p>
        
        <p>I remembered something from college. Back when I competed in a research poster presentation, I realized the power of turning ideas into compelling visuals and stories. That was when it first hit me: <em>what if I pitch myself like a product?</em> Instead of just answering questions, I could present like I did in front of judges.</p>

        <p>That idea got me.</p>

        <p>So this time, I treated the interview like a pitch deck.</p>

        <p><em>I’m the product. I'm the pitcher.</em></p>
        
        <p><em>I have to sell myself.</em></p>

        <div class='quote'>
          <div class='line'></div>
          <p><em>“The stage is yours.”</em></p>
        </div>

        <p>So I made custom presentation slides that walked the interviewers through my background, my creative process, and the value I could bring to their team. I packaged myself as a design solution to their problems—someone who could help them—not just another applicant with skills on paper.</p>

        <p>That creative approach made all the difference.</p>

        <p>Not only did it leave a lasting impression, it showed them how I think, how I tell stories, and how I solve problems—all through design.</p>

        <p>Like Cole Pfeiffer in <em>Prison Break</em>, who walked into a boardroom unprepared for a surprise presentation—but somehow delivered it with such confidence and charm that he fooled everyone. He still aced it with a bold and confident pitch. I decided to do the same. I wasn’t just going to answer interview questions; I was going to own the room. Even if I didn’t know what the other candidates were bringing to the table, I was going to make sure mine was <em>unforgettable</em>.</p>

        <div class='separator'></div>

        <h3>The Strategy: Be the product. Be the pitcher.</h3>

        <p>I knew I had the hard skills. But so did everyone else in the final round.</p>

        <p><em>What would set me apart?</em></p>

        <p><strong>Effort. Presentation. Storytelling.</strong></p>

        <p>Instead of just showing up with answers, a good portfolio, and a polished resume, I made a <strong>beautifully designed slide deck</strong> that introduced me. Not just my work history or portfolio, but who I am, how I think, and what kind of value I bring to the table.</p>

        <p>I designed the presentation like I would for a product pitch, but this time, the product was <em>myself</em>.</p>

        <p>Here’s what I included:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <img src='../assets/images/emojis/check_emoji_image.webp' alt='Icon'>
            <p><em>A brief personal intro with personality (not just credentials)</em></p>
          </li>
          
          <li>
            <img src='../assets/images/emojis/check_emoji_image.webp' alt='Icon'>
            <p><em>My values, principles, and approach to creative problem-solving</em></p>
          </li>
          
          <li>
            <img src='../assets/images/emojis/check_emoji_image.webp' alt='Icon'>
            <p><em>Case studies of past projects—but framed like mini stories</em></p>
          </li>
          
          <li>
            <img src='../assets/images/emojis/check_emoji_image.webp' alt='Icon'>
            <p><em>My favorite design failure—and what it taught me</em></p>
          </li>
          
          <li>
            <img src='../assets/images/emojis/check_emoji_image.webp' alt='Icon'>
            <p><em>A closing slide that answered why I’m the best fit for the role</em></p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>It wasn’t just about making pretty slides and wasn’t just telling them I was the right fit. It was about showing them how I think, work, and communicate in a way that was impossible to ignore.</p>

        <div class='separator'></div>

        <h3>Why This Worked</h3>

        <p>Most candidates rely only on their resumes and verbal answers. Most interviewers are bored after hearing the same answers all day. But I knew this company was hiring a <em>creative</em>—so why not show them how I turn ordinary moments into creative expression?</p>

        <p>This approach demonstrated more than my design skills. It showed soft skills like:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <img src='../assets/images/emojis/check_emoji_image.webp' alt='Icon'>
            <p><em>Initiative and preparation</em></p>
          </li>
          
          <li>
            <img src='../assets/images/emojis/check_emoji_image.webp' alt='Icon'>
            <p><em>Empathy (understanding how the interviewer would perceive my pitch)</em></p>
          </li>
          
          <li>
            <img src='../assets/images/emojis/check_emoji_image.webp' alt='Icon'>
            <p><em>Communication and storytelling</em></p>
          </li>
          
          <li>
            <img src='../assets/images/emojis/check_emoji_image.webp' alt='Icon'>
            <p><em>Passion for the craft</em></p>
          </li>
          
          <li>
            <img src='../assets/images/emojis/check_emoji_image.webp' alt='Icon'>
            <p><em>You care enough to go the extra mile</em></p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>And above all, it showed that I care enough to go beyond the basic requirements.</p>

        <div class='separator'></div>

        <h3>The Result?</h3>

        <p>The interviewers were impressed, not just my skills, not just by my slides, but by the <em>thought</em> and <em>storytelling</em> behind them. I didn’t just tell them who I was—<em>I showed them</em>.</p>

        <p>A few days later, I got the job offer. I was happy.</p>

        <div class='separator'></div>

        <h3>Final Thoughts: Stand Out by Showing Up Differently. Be An Outlier.</h3>

        <p>If you’re in a sea of candidates with similar hard skills, find a way to stand out through your <em>soft skills</em> and <em>presentation</em>. You don’t need flashy animations or over-the-top effects—<em>just intentional, thoughtful design that reflects you</em>.</p>

        <p>Of course, this technique wouldn’t be enough. It’s not like it would magically work. You still need hard skills tho, and sometimes experience—to truly fit the role. <em>It also depends on the role or job</em>. And yes, a bit of luck plays a part too. But by taking that approach, you're also showing your soft skills, the ability to put serious effort into something simple, which can make a huge difference as part of a team.</p>

        <p>Sometimes, your creativity isn’t just for clients or campaigns; it’s your most powerful tool to sell yourself.</p>

        <p>Whatever you do today, do it with the confidence like a boy in a Batman shirt.</p>

        <p>Always do your best, no matter the size of your audience.</p>

        <p>Namaste. Best of luck!</p>
